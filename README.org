* Description

esh is a program for text templating using awk(1p) and sh(1p).  Templates
are compiled into a shell script which outputs the original template and
the result of evaluating shell commands embedded in the template.


#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE:
hello <% printf "%s" "$USER" %>
#+END_EXAMPLE  

Compiles into:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE:
printf "%s" 'hello '
printf "%s" "$USER"
echo
#+END_EXAMPLE

Anything embedded within "<% " and " %>" is inserted verbatim into the
resulting shell script.  These delimiters can be escaped with "<%%" and
"%%>" respectively.  Embedded code cannot span multiple lines.

* Usage

eshc(1) accepts template files as arguments or reads stdin and outputs a
sh(1p) script on stdout.

esh(1) is a thin wrapper that pipes the output of eshc(1) into sh(1p).

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE:
esh my-template.html.esh > my-template.html
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Installation

#+BEGIN_SRC: sh
# installs into /usr/local
sudo make install 
# installs into /foo/bar
PREFIX=/foo/bar make install 
#+END_SRC

The makefile also supports an =uninstall= target, which does the obvious.
